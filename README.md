# hadashboard
Welcome! This repository will eventually be updated with components of my Home Assistant dashboard.  
I've had a few people express interest, so I'm happy to share what I've built so far â€” and hopefully, it helps or inspires you in your own setup.

If you find anything here useful and feel like supporting the work, you can [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/richardbmh). I really appreciate it!
